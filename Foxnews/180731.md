Bonus Track, with Laura Ingle. Taking you deep inside the music. 欢迎大家和劳拉·英格尔一起走进今天的《附赠曲目》。带你深入音乐。

Sacramento rockers Tesla are currently out on tour this summer with Joan Jett and Styx 这个夏天，萨克拉门托摇滚乐队特斯拉目前正在与琼·杰特以及Styx一起巡演，

as the band rocks on after 35-plus years of being together. 三十五余年的风风雨雨，乐队仍在高歌猛进。

"We look at each other every day and we go, 'Wow, we've been together a long time.'" “每天看着对方，就会觉得，'哇，我们真的在一起很久了呢。'”

I caught up with Tesla's bass player Brian Wheat backstage this month, 本月，我堵到了特斯拉的贝司手布莱恩·惠特，

where I found him with a paint brush in his hand, 发现他手里拿着画笔，

putting some color over a photo he had taken on tour that was printed on canvas, 正在他印在帆布上的照片上涂涂画画，而那张照片是他们巡演时拍的，

an idea brought to him by a gallery owner who liked his photo skills. 而这一想法出自喜欢他拍照技巧的一位画廊主。

"He said 'you should try painting on your photos, there's some way you can put paint and enhance them.‘" “他说，‘你可以试试在照片上画画，你可以用画画的方式来给照片加工。’”

He's got 25 paintings now, some, which have been featured in the Wentworth Galleries, 如今，他已经有25幅画作了，其中有一部分还曾在温特沃斯画廊展出过，

which has art from other rockers, including Paul Stanley of KISS, 有些还是其他摇滚歌手的作品，比如Kiss乐队乐队的保罗·史丹利，

Rick Allen of Def Leppard, Ric Ocasek of the Cars, even Peter Max. 威豹乐队的瑞克·艾伦，汽车乐队的的里克·奥卡塞克，甚至还有彼得·马克斯。

When I asked him what he likes better, being up on stage or in front of a canvas, he replied: 当我问他更喜欢在舞台上表演还是更喜欢画画儿时，他回答到：

"Ah ha! Being alive!" “啊哈！更喜欢活着！”

When my daughter turned 10, I noticed insecurity creeping in. 我的女儿满10岁时，我注意到了她的身边潜伏着一些不安全因素。

And just telling her she's awesome and to ignore the haters, doesn't seem to help: 单纯告诉她她很棒，让她无视那些怀恨在心的人似乎起不了什么作用：

"This generation doesn't do as you say, they only do as you do." “这一代人并不会按照你说的做，你自己做了他们才会跟着那么做。”

So the advice from mother-of-four and author of 'Happiest Mom on the Block,' Katerina Mayants is to be the change you want to see in your children by working on yourself: 身为四个孩子的母亲以及《整个街区最幸福的母亲》一书的作者，凯特琳娜·马扬茨建议，你希望孩子变成什么样，就亲自示范给他们看：

"And you start to raise your own voice and make it louder than the voices that are coming-of advice, of criticism-from people around you, that's when you're bulletproof." “当你开始提高嗓门，让你自己的声音盖过了周围其他建议或批评的声音时，可以说你就已经刀枪不入了。”

She says then the whole family can focus on living the best life they can: 她还说，做到了这一点，整个家庭才能将精力集中在尽可能过上好日子上面：

"Instead of constantly being plagued by stresses and anxieties “而不是反复被压力、焦虑，

and all of the things that come when we're trying to impress everybody else outside of the home." 以及我们试图讨好家庭之外的其他人所引起的各种问题困扰。”

Spending less time on social media can help with confidence. 缩短花费在社交媒体上的时间能够帮助孩子树立信心。

And let your kids know you face similar challenges with criticism in life, 让孩子们知道你自己在生活中也会遇到被批评之类的问题，

but that you're own opinion is what really matters. 但有自己的见解才是最重要的。

Show them how to move on. 用你的行动告诉他们怎么迈过这些坎坷。

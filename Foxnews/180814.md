I'm Ashley Dvorkin with your FOX Celebrity Profile. 我是阿什利·德沃尔金，欢迎大家跟我一起走进今天的《福克斯名人榜》。

Actor Tom Holland leads the way for the new 'Spider-Man' installment dubbed 'Spider-Man: Homecoming.' 演员汤姆·赫兰德携《蜘蛛侠》系列新电影《蜘蛛侠：英雄归来》作客本期《福布斯名人榜》。

He shared his favorite ways this Spidey movie differs from it's predecessors: 他跟我们分享了他最喜欢的这部电影不同于之前几部的地方：

"My favorite thing is that he's a kid. It's a high school movie about a superhero kid. “我最喜欢的地方就是这次他还只是一个孩子。这是一部关于一个超级英雄高中生活的电影。

And I think that's something we've never seen before. 这个设置应该是大家未曾见过的。

I think if you gave a 15-year-old superpowers, he would have the time of his life and we really get to see that on screen and it's a lot of fun." 我觉得一个15岁的孩子本来有着大好的人生等着享受，这一点在电影中得到了充分的阐释，如果他被赋予了超能力，就会变得非常有趣。”

Holland spoke about how it stands out in the way Peter Parker isn't just dealing with his new superpowers 赫兰德说的是彼得·帕克不仅仅要应对自己新获得的超能力，

but, lots of high school stuff just like any other kid!: 还要和其他孩子一样应付各种高中生的问题！

"It's difficult to relate to Tony Stark because his problems are his Audi R8 didn't arrive on time whereas Peter's problem is that he doesn't have enough money for the bus fare. “这让人很难把彼得·帕克和钢铁侠托尼·斯塔克联系起来，因为托尼的问题是他的奥迪R8没有按时到，而彼得的问题是他连坐公交车的钱都没有。

And that's something that kids around the world can relate to." 而这是世界各地的孩子都能够产生共鸣的问题。”

As for where the franchise goes from here? 至于《蜘蛛侠》系列未来的走向……

"We have only scratched the surface of what we can do with this character, you know." “这个角色我们现在只能算是触及了个皮毛。”

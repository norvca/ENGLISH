It all started when Jeff Reitz was out of work and someone got him a year's pass to the Happiest Place on Earth, 一切还要从杰夫·雷茨丢了工作，然后有人给了他一张世界上最快乐的乐园迪士尼的年票时开始说起。

even now that he's gainfully employed, he visits every day after work: 尽管现在他已经找到了高薪工作，每天下班后他还是会去迪士尼：

"This is probably end up being even Guinness World Records 最后我可能会创下一项吉尼斯世界纪录，

and that wasn't even something when this first started that was planned." 而且，这事儿还不是什么事先就计划好的事情。”

Not only does he enjoy Disneyland. He says's it's healthy: 他不仅仅非常喜欢迪士尼，还说去迪士尼有益于身体健康：

"It's been my workout gym. This past year I've lost about 40 pounds." “迪士尼已经成了我的健身房了。过去的一年里我瘦了将近36斤了。”

He says it's actually quite affordable, if you buy an annual pass: 他说买年票的话其实还是挺便宜的：

"Even at the top of the line right now is $1,049. “现在最贵的年票也才1049美元。

If you were to come at a single day basis and pay cash at the gate, 如果你每天都来，然后用现金在门口买票的话，

you'd be spending over $65,000 for the year." 那一年下来就是6.5万美元。”

And in case you're wondering, 2,000 visits in a row comes out to about five and a half years! 而且，如果你好奇的话，他连着去了2000次迪士尼，一共花了五年半的时间！

Fox on Family. When school's out, summer learning loss can set in especially in reading: 欢迎收听福克斯家庭新闻。学校放假后，缺乏阅读引起的暑假学习退步尤为明显：

"Often times children are right at reading level, “通常，孩子们正值扩充阅读量的年纪，

some are, you know, more advanced and some are lagging behind a little bit 有些孩子在阅读方面较为靠前，有些则稍有滞后，

and that extra loss over the summer really hurts those children." 而暑期阅读的额外缺失会对这些孩子造成极大的伤害。”

Literacy advocate, author, and mother-of-seven Noelle Randall says just 20 to 30 minutes of reading a day can keep learning going 身为素养倡导人，作家兼一个七岁孩子的母亲诺艾尔·兰德尔说，每天阅读20到30分钟有助于保持学习状态

and the fun stuff counts, like comics and joke books, as long as they're not too easy: 而且阅读漫画、笑话书籍等有趣的内容很重要，只要这些内容没有太过简单：

"It's really just that cognitive development, “重要的是认知能力的提升，

anything that kind of gets that brain working and starts working that side of the brain 任何能够让大脑内控制认知能力的区域运转起来的阅读都可以，

where they're kind of creating some of the images, forward thinking, you know they're filling in the gaps." 以为阅读的时候这部分大脑会产生一些图像，会推动大脑进行思考，弥补此前认知的不足。”

Workbooks can give a leg up in other subjects. 练习册则可以帮助提升其他学科的能力。

And not everyday is okay; any summer learning is better than none: 即便不是每天都有阅读也没有关系，有阅读总比没有阅读好：

"The key to it is obviously trying to dedicate to it as much as you can and be consistent so that it is a routine." “关键是要尽可能地专注，尽可能坚持下来，形成阅读的习惯。”

Randall also urges parents to spend that brief learning time with kids, so it feels more like fun, not like homework. 兰德尔还敦促父母与孩子们一起度过短暂的学习时间，所以它感觉更有趣，不像功课。

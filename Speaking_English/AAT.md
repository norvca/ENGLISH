# American Intonation

## Don't speak word by word

"Bob is on the phone" sound like "Ba Biz'on the foun"



## Three ways to make intonation

1. **Volume** (speak louder)
2. **Length** (stretch out a word)
3. **Pitch** (change your tone)



## Stress the word by meaning changes

1. **I** didn't say he stole the money.  (Someone else said it)
2. I **didn't** say he stole the money.  (that's not true at all)
3. I didn't **say** he stole the money.  (I only suggested the possibility)
4. I didn't say **he** stole the money.  (I think someone else took it)
5. I didn't say he **stole** the money.  (Maybe he just borrowed it)
6. I didn't say he stole **the** money.  (but rather some other money)
7. I didn't say he stole the **money**.  (He may have taken some jewelry)

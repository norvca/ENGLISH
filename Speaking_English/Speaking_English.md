# Vowel

## four neutral vowels

/ɪ/ : sit

/ɛ/ : bed

/ʌ/ : bud

/ʊ/ : good





# consonant

## TIPS

1. pronouncing every consonant

2. vowel is longer before voiced consonant

   eg: `save / safe` `pig / pick` `lied / light`

   `save` has the voiced consonant `v`, so the vowel `a` is longer than the  `a` in  `safe`

3. `T ` between two vowels sounds like `D`

   eg: `better / auto / city water`

4. `ED` in the end

   1. if the last letter is `T` or `D`, `ed`  is a separate syllable. like `waited / addtended / count`
   2. if the last letter is voiceless ,  `ed` becomes a T soiund
